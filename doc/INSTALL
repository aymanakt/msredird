Can't get any simpler than that...but before we get into that, i'd like
to remind the reader of this that this package is very 'raw' and it was
a work in progress before it made it to the public.


__You need to have pthread library installed__

- change dir into src
- issue make
- issue make install
- copy the binary into your favourite bin directory.


HOWTO
The configuration file found in /etc/msredird/msredird.conf is rather
simple and can be used to set the listening port number. Default is 7000.

There's currently only one way of specifying the modem devices, and thats
through an environmental variable named 'MSREDIRD_DEVLST'.
The value of it is ':' seperated list of modem devices, e.g.:
/dev/modem1:/dev/modem2:/dev/modem

Direct your queries to the list. See the 'README' file for more information.
